            <h2>Forever - Lewis Capaldi</h2>
            <p>Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
                Still, here we are, back in Hanover 99
                Just like old times all over
                Under the exit lights as beautiful as ever
                I really wish that I dressed up a little better
                No regrets is what we said
                We can't go back again
                <br>
                <br>
                Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
                That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
                I never said that we would die together
                That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
                Nobody said that it would last forever
                <br>
                <br>
                Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
                Wish you the best, I would if I was able
                Morning light, it stings a little
                Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
                Had too much tonic wine, sometimes it does the talking
                Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for
                <br>
                <br>
                Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
                That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
                I never said that we would die together
                That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
                Nobody said that it would last forever
                Forever
                Forever
                Forever
                <br>
                <br>
                Nobody said that it would last forever
                That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
                I never said that we would die together
                That doesn't mean it was a lie
                They'll never take those long summer days
                When love was untamed
                Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember
                Nobody said that it would last forever</p>
